Topic 3:
Rebasing

Rebasing is the concept parallel yet slightly different to merging in git.

Here We create patches of branches and apply them on top of other branches as new commits.

It works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you’re on,
saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto,
and finally applying each change in turn.

To do rebasing apply the following steps:
git checkout sub_branch
git rebase main_branch

git checkout main_branch
git merge sub_branch

Topic 4:
History of git
In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down,
and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked.
This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned
while using BitKeeper.
